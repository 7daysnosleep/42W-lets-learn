9: 42h | Kick-off: Welcome to 42 Basecamp


11: 30h | Tribe check-in 


12: 30h | Start working on your first project 

**3. TRIBE CHECK-INS** 

Woo! This is your tribe’s first check-in. Follow the guidelines below to get started on the right foot!


*Total time: 30-40 minutes* :alarm_clock: 

**BEFORE YOU START: HAVE YOUR CAMERAS ON!** :relaxed: 

Keep in mind that: _"Each tribes' objective is to support the exchange of knowledge, experiences and learning among its members."_ 

Every check-in will follow a similar structure, giving each tribe member 5 minutes to go over things they want to share with their tribe. A tribe check-in is an important part of the day. It’s a team huddle, an opportunity to check-in with each other to see how your tribe mates are doing as well as a chance for each tribe member to voice any feedback to your tribe mates. Follow these guidelines to get you started:

**:alarm_clock: PART 1: TIME-KEEPING** 

Designate a time-keeper, who will be the person responsible for monitoring the time during tribe check-ins throughout Basecamp.

:point_right: Tip # 1: the time-keeper should be someone who thinks of themselves as well organized and is willing to take on the time-keeper role;

:point_right: Tip # 2: people tend to get carried away and may go over their time limit! :sweat_smile: make sure you’re strict with keeping track of time or the tribe check-in may go undesirably over!

:point_right: Tip # 3: The time-keeper should also help guide the tribe check-ins by asking questions for each tribe member and helping keep them on track.

[10:55 AM]

**PART 2: INTRODUCTIONS** :handshake:

Each camper takes 3 minutes to introduce themselves to their tribe, answering: 

:white_check_mark: Name? 

:white_check_mark: Age? 

:white_check_mark: Where do you live? 

:white_check_mark: Do you have any programming experience? 

:white_check_mark: How are you feeling about your first day?

**PART 3: GETTING YOUR TRIBE ORGANIZED** :tent:

Let's do some basic organizing for a second here: 


1. Does your tribe prefer to work synchronously (at the same time) or asynchronously (at different times)? 

2. If you prefer working asynchronously, go over what that will look like for all of you in terms of staying on top of tasks and study schedules. Otherwise if you rather work synchronously, agree a time to all get together each day!

It’s worth remembering that you don’t need to be together ALL the time and that you should also interact with campers from different tribes. :wink: 

**PART 4: ASKING FOR HELP** :raised_hands:

Does anyone in your tribe need any help with a topic? If so, now’s a good time to ask. Similarly, if you need help, make it known!

**With that, you have already completed your tribe’s first check-in. Now, let's get working on your first project!** 

:bulb: **WobBot’s TIP:** 
You can think of our community as a giant distributed brain. The more you share your own ideas, approaches to problem solving, challenges and solutions, the more value you bring to the community. So share as much as possible - don’t be shy! The more knowledge you share, the more beneficial it is for you and other campers alike.

To start the week, let's change up our tribe check-ins and dive a little deeper into each Camper's experience so far. 

Today, each person will take turns to do their tribe check-in routine as suggested below (10 minutes each):

:heavy_check_mark: Briefly answer (1 ~ 2 minutes): how are you feeling? How was your weekend? 

:heavy_check_mark: What was your main challenge from last week? (try to choose the biggest one only, for the sake of time!)


:heavy_check_mark: Now the other tribe members, one at a time, do the following sequence: 

:heavy_check_mark: Confirm that what you heard (e.g.: “I understood that your main challenge is with work organization”.) 

:heavy_check_mark: Make some suggestions of what could be done to overcome the challenge (e.g: “make a list of daily tasks and use it to keep track of the things you need to do”) 

:heavy_check_mark: At the end, whoever presented the challenge states which suggestions they liked best and how they plan to put them in practice.

:point_right: **3.3: CONCLUSION**

Each member of the tribe takes one minute to answer (addressing the rest of the tribe):  

:heavy_check_mark: What was the main thing you learned last week? 

:heavy_check_mark: What struck you the most?

**If a team member does not participate in the evaluation session, they will receive a 0 as well as the rest of their team.** This is the traditional 42 way, and serves to prevent someone from letting the team down (obviously, we will be tolerant for any extenuating circumstances).
